Perfect ‚úÖ ‚Äî let‚Äôs design a **Parking Lot Allotment System** for an **Indian residential building**, supporting all types of vehicles (2-wheeler, 4-wheeler, electric, guest, etc.), applying **Java OOP principles**.

We‚Äôll cover:

* **README.md** (for GitHub)
* **Java implementation** (single file for now, modular OOP structure)

# üöó Parking Lot Allotment System (Java OOP Project)

A real-world **Object-Oriented Java** implementation of a **Parking Lot Allotment System** designed for **Indian residential buildings**.  
This project efficiently manages multiple types of vehicles ‚Äî two-wheelers, four-wheelers, electric vehicles, and guest vehicles ‚Äî while ensuring fair allocation, capacity limits, and billing.

---

## üè¢ Use Case

The residential building has:
- Limited parking slots for **different vehicle types**
- Priority slots for **residents** and **electric vehicles**
- Temporary slots for **guests**
- Billing and overstay penalty for visitors
- Edge case handling for **full parking**, **invalid vehicle types**, and **duplicate vehicle entries**

---

## üß© OOP Concepts Applied

| **Concept** | **Example in this System** |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Private attributes for `Vehicle`, `Slot`, etc., with proper getters/setters |
| **Inheritance** | `Vehicle` ‚Üí `TwoWheeler`, `FourWheeler`, `ElectricVehicle` |
| **Polymorphism** | `calculateCharge()` behaves differently for each vehicle type |
| **Abstraction** | Abstract `Vehicle` class defines common methods |
| **Composition** | `ParkingLot` contains `List<Slot>` and `Map<Vehicle, Slot>` relationships |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

‚úÖ Allocate and deallocate parking slots  
‚úÖ Prevent duplicate vehicle entries  
‚úÖ Separate area for electric vehicle charging  
‚úÖ Guest vehicle billing and penalty handling  
‚úÖ Display all parked vehicles  
‚úÖ Edge case handling for full parking or invalid input

## üíª Example Output

```

‚úÖ Car WB06A1234 parked successfully in Slot S2
‚úÖ Bike WB06B9988 parked successfully in Slot S1
‚ö° EV WB06E7777 parked in charging slot S5
‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate Entry: Vehicle WB06A1234 is already parked!
‚ùå No parking slots available for FourWheelers
üí∞ Bill for Guest Car WB06G9090: ‚Çπ180.0

## üß™ Edge Cases Covered

| **Scenario** | **Behavior** |
|---------------|--------------|
| Duplicate vehicle number | Shows warning message |
| Parking full | Displays "‚ùå No parking slots available" |
| Invalid vehicle type | Handles gracefully |
| Electric vehicle priority | Allocates charging slot |
| Guest billing | Calculates charge and penalty dynamically |

Would you like me to **expand this version** into a **package-structured multi-file project** (like a real Java app with folders `/models`, `/services`, `/main`)?
That version can be uploaded directly to GitHub or IntelliJ/Eclipse.
